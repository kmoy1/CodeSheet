This is the documentation for CodeSheet commands.

A worksheet is defined by a set of question blocks. Because the input file is 
markdown, all commands are prefaced with a hashtag (#). Commands may also include flags, which
are always prefixed with a hyphen (-). They always follow the first word of the command. 

# DEFQ defines a question block, which is (and must be) ended with # ENDQ.
Immediately following is the name of the question, which will uniquely identify a question object. 

Immediately following the question block is metatext, which usually consists of question text 
itself, although other information may be placed here. 

The next part of a question block consists of an input type. As of now, the possible input types are:
- NUMBER: A (default) 4-character space for numerical input. The width may be altered with a flag. 
- ONELINE: A one-line input that spans the page. This is usually used for short-answer inputs but may also be used for numerical inputs.
- BOX: A paragraph-like box. 
- MC: Multiple choice. Multiple choice inputs must immediately follow,  in dictionary-like format: (Key1):DisplayChoice1, (Key2): DisplayChoice2, etc.
Note only DisplayChoice(i) will be displayed to the user, and in the order provided. 

There are also special (prototype) code inputs available:
- # WWPD: Python Interpreter with pre-loaded inputs. In order, each line corresponds to a Python interpreter input, and input will be formulated for each as a question. This follows a "What would Python Do" structure. 

An (optional) SOLUTION box follows. This will perform autograding of student answers, comparing their answer to the solution provided. For cases with numerical or multiple-choice questions, the number/choice follows #SOLUTION. A sentence string can also follow for longer paragraph answers, though it will only serve as a reference answer (no autograding). Immediate feedback can be toggled. By default, doctests and solutions are hidden. 

For coding questions, -lang=(...) will specify a language. For now, supported languages are:
-Python.

The -DOCTEST flag will run a doctest for the specified language. Supported doctest languages are:
-Python.
